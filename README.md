Although there are a lot of areas where this technology can boom.
As I am currently working for a insureTech startup, I am quite confident to pitch the idea of insureTech transactions based on blockchain.
As developers are constantly collaborating in the improvement of ecosystem, and specially after some developers cracked layer-2 insfrastructure. Cryptocurrency will be the next big tech in the upcoming decade, with faster and cheaper transaction without hampering the underlying advantage of layer-1 blockchain.

InsureTech with Ethereum
Lot of insureTech offers online web/ mobile services which helps users bypass the brokers and get the policy renewed imediately.
Still a lot of development in this domain is currently under process but mostly these companies focus on their AI/ML stacks. While some are also using IoT on corporate level. 

Problem:
A lot of trust issues are there among the parties taking part in the transaction.
Documents tempering and forging is an alarming situation, where the deals can cost huge amount specially on corporate level.

Solution.
Documents can be stored on blockchain with encryption protocols, making consensus on the stored document without hampering it's security.
This will provide an original uneditable document where both parties can agree on.
initialy this can be started for SME, MSME, extended to big corporates. As these people can bear the heavy cost of layer1 transactions.

Later this can be extended to personal insurences when transactions become cheaper using layer2.

This is closely related to defi orgs 

There are lot of opportunity in this domain, while still only some people are turning this stone.
